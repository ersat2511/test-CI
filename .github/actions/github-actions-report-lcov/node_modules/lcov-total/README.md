## About The Project

This simple package aim to parse `lcov.info` files and provide the total coverage `Number` without fancy formatting or anything else, either in stdout or programmatically.

Here's why:

- You need to assest coverage in your CI and fail below certain threshold
- you don't want to do unredable `awk` chains
- every other options outputs fancy colored output which is tediuous to parse and error prone

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Installation

You can install locally

```sh
npm install lcov-total
```

You can install glocally

```sh
npm install -g lcov-total
```

Or use NPX

```sh
npx lcov-total
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

You can use `lcov-total` from command line providing `lcov.info` file location eg:

```sh
npx lcov-total lcov.info
#Â 100.00
```

If you pass the `--gte=value` flag you will get an exitCode 0 or 1 based on resulting `coverage >= value` expression, eg:

```sh
npx lcov-total lcov.info --gte=90
echo $?
# 0
```

Or programmatically

```js
const lcovTotal = require("lcov-total");
lcovTotal("/path/to/lcov.info"); // this throws if any error
```
